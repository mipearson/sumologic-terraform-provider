# sumologic_polling_source
Provides a Sumologic Polling source. This source is used to import data from  AWS S3 buckets.

__IMPORTANT:__ The AWS credentials are stored in plain-text in the state. This is a potential security issue.

## Example Usage
```hcl
locals {
  filters = [{
    name        = "Exclude Comments"
    filter_type = "Exclude"
    regexp      = "#.*"
  }]
}

resource "sumologic_polling_source" "s3_audit" {
  name          = "Amazon S3 Audit"
  description   = "My description"
  category      = "aws/s3audit"
  content_type  = "AwsS3AuditBucket"
  scan_interval = 300000
  paused        = false
  collector_id  = "${sumologic_collector.collector.id}"
  filters       = "${local.filters}"

  authentication {
    access_key = "someKey"
    secret_key = "******"
  }

  path {
    bucket_name     = "Bucket1"
    path_expression = "*"
  }
}

resource "sumologic_collector" "collector" {
  name        = "my-collector"
  description = "Just testing this"
}
```
